  <p>Somehow, I came to own a toilet paper holder. These kinds of things happen as you age. </p>

<p>I’m very unhappy with it. Granted, I’m not going to shell out for a new toilet paper holder. it’s about as low on the priority list as possible, but still drives me nuts every other week when I refill it. </p>

<p>Here’s the culprit, riddled with awful design:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tp-holder/tp-holder.jpg" alt="the work of the devil" /></p>

<p>What on god’s green earth were the designers thinking? This thing has literally one job - to hold up to three tp rolls until needed. It’s a god damn failure. </p>

<p>Why can’t I just drop a roll in and have it go straight to the bottom? <strong>Why</strong> would anyone think spaced out rings would be the best structure for this? I will venture to say it’s about as awful a design as it could possibly be while still being functional enough to not throw in the garbage. </p>

<p>Getting the next roll of tp out is just as difficult as putting one in. There actually is an opening in the side to facilitate this, which I can’t access due to my space constraints. But even if I had access to it - it only goes down half way. What about when the user needs to access that last roll? I have to shove my arm down the entire thing, grab the inside of the roll by making a peace sign with my fingers, and and pull it up slowly, hoping the roll doesn’t get caught on those stupid metal rings. </p>

<p>So how would I do it? Simple. Put the vertical metal pieces on the inside of the rings, and increase the diameter of the thing slightly. This allows rolls to slide down effortlessly. Make three thin channels, 90 degrees apart, that go all the way to the bottom of the tp holder for easy removal. There are three of them for easy access to your tp no matter how your bathroom is laid out. Since the vertical poles at the top may catch the rolls upon entry, file them down and smooth out their edges to make a clean transition to the top-most ring. </p>

<p>A better design might even involve simply removing half of the siding, making the tp holder act more as a shelf than a tube. After all, it’s hanging on arguably the most stationary object in your entire house. It’s not going anywhere. </p>

<p>I could do a killer redesign of this toilet paper holder. That is, unless it’s not a toilet paper holder at all. </p>
