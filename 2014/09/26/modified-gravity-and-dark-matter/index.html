    <h1>Modified Gravity and Dark Matter</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I wrote this in college. Just found it. It’s about modified gravity hypotheses, which are alternative explanations to the same weird phenomenon that made physicists think up ‘dark matter’ in the first place. Enjoy. </p>

<h2 id="purpose--direction">Purpose &amp; Direction</h2>

<p>The Dark Matter Hypothesis has been a point of discussion in the Physics community since Fritz Zwicky’s suggestion of it in 1933 as an explanation for observed behavior of galaxy cluster rotation. In almost 80 years, the make-up of this hypothetical matter is still unknown and has never been directly observed. Monstrous neutrino detectors costing hundreds of millions of dollars are being constructed and operating deep underground in laboratories to hopefully discover evidence of dark matter’s existence and make-up. </p>

<p>Alternative theories of gravity, collectively known as Modified Gravitation (MG), have been proposed to explain these otherwise irreconcilable phenomena without requiring the existence of dark matter. One issue with these theories, which in general posit slight changes to Einstein’s field equations of general relativity, is that they all operate slightly differently and there is a disconnect between the various phenomena they attempt to explain. </p>

<p>Some proponents of MG theories suggest that ideas regarding dark matter do not necessarily find themselves within the realm of Science as a discipline. The famed 20th century philosopher Karl Popper suggested that scientific theories necessarily must be falsifiable, lest these claims fall into the realm of theology, philosophy, or mere opinion. Taken in this context, the pursuit of elusive dark matter becomes more of a philosophical investigation than actual science. This “downgraded” status means that these explorations carry much less import than other theories that remain true to the essence of Science. As such, anomalies in cosmological data should forgo further research into dark matter and instead focus primarily on developing current and new MG theories that offer explanations of the same phenomena without resort to hypothetical unobservables. </p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-the-physics-and-philosophy-of-gravitation">A Brief History of the Physics and Philosophy of Gravitation</h3>

<p>The movement of the celestial bodies has always fascinated mankind. Although early thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Hipparchus mused on the nature of the heavens, the first real scientific analysis of the motions of these bodies is usually attributed to Ptolemy, who wrote in greek during the second century CE, when the Earth was still considered the center of the Universe. In his Almagest, he suggests the movements of the planetary bodies revolved around the Earth in more or less circular orbits that also underwent movement through epicycles, ultimately characterizing a loopy passage through space (Figure 1). These paths were based on both observations and the particular philosophy he brought to his work - namely, a geocentric view of the Universe. It is evident, from what we currently know about the behavior of the solar system, that the influence of the geocentric view greatly skewed this thinker’s ability to postulate accurately about stars and planets. </p>

<p>Early in the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus published his seminal work, De revolutionibis orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), in which he explicates a heliocentric view of the Universe and thus sparks what is known as the Copernican Revolution. He is responsible for positing that the Sun is the center of the Universe about which all else revolves. This hypothesis greatly outraged the powerful Catholic Church at the time, as it challenged the prevailing “philosophy” of man’s central position in the cosmos. </p>

<p>Near the end of Copernicus’s life, both Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler were hard at work on theories inspired by this great thinker. Kepler is primarily responsible for describing the three rules of planetary motion and correctly asserting that celestial bodies take an elliptical orbit around the sun. Galileo, using his improved telescope that he invented, discovered the moons orbiting Jupiter, essentially putting the nail in the coffin of geocentrism. The fact that Galileo was infamously condemned during the Inquisition is testament to the scientific vision of putting facts before previously-held philosophies, thus allowing new ones to develop from the ashes of the old. These advancements, among others, set the stage for one of the largest figures in the Scientific world, whose ideas would serve as a starting point for a mathematical description of the Universe. </p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, in 1687, fundamentally revolutionized Physics and distinctly set it apart from philosophy as a science in the most fundamental sense. In his Principia Mathematica, he puts forth his universal theory of gravitation, which, he suggests, is a mathematical law in the form of a single equation that governs all motion of bodies in the Universe. Although this theory can successfully explain the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies, Newton acknowledges that he cannot account for what exactly gravity is, or by what mechanism it is mediated. Newton was deeply troubled by this mysterious ‘action at a distance’, but he was confident in the mathematics, and mused privately over how this could all be true. His equation for gravity saw hundreds of years of great success, firmly planting him in the history books as one of the fathers of science. </p>

<p>Scientific theories are only valid until an exception to the rule is found, which prompts further investigation into the field. Albert Einstein, in the early 1900s, put forth his theory of special relativity, which merged the concepts of space and time as an inextricably linked whole. He later began to examine Newton’s law of gravitation in the context of his unified spacetime and began another scientific revolution when he proposed general relativity in 1916. Essentially, the problem Newton had with action at a distance also bothered Einstein, who postulated that gravity was synonymous with the warping of spacetime, and more massive objects warped the fabric of spacetime more than less massive ones. Einstein’s theory was thoroughly tested and was found to be in concordance with Newton’s gravity at low speeds, and could also explain other recently observed phenomena that did not correspond with Newton’s equation. It seemed as though the issue of gravity’s behavior had mostly been solved in this triumph and could act as a firm ground upon which other theories may build themselves. </p>

<h2 id="dark-matter">Dark Matter</h2>

<p>Developments in astronomy led to the ability to probe ever deeper into the vast expanses of the Universe. Einstein’s general relativity brought about a prolific burst of cosmological ideas during the 1920s and 1930s, around the same time that quantum mechanics was probing deeper and deeper into the microscopic structure of matter. Big Bang Cosmology was developing as an explanatory framework for the origin of the Universe. In the midst of all of these developments, a swiss astronomer named Fritz Zwicky in 1934 found an anomaly between his observations of galaxy clusters and accepted gravitational theory, and put forth an idea that would change the overall picture of astronomy for decades. </p>

<p>Zwicky, in his On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae, describes how the rotational speeds of the Coma cluster of galaxies was much faster than would be predicted by applying standard gravitational theory to the system. He postulates that there must be significantly more mass concentrated at the center of this cluster to make up for this discrepancy, but it was undetectable by telescopes and thus didn’t interact with light. Thus, the idea of dark matter was born. </p>

<p>As technology improved, more similar observations began to come forth from the physics community. In 1970, Vera Rubin observed the rotation of a single galaxy and determined that the stars contained within all rotated at roughly the same speed, despite their distance from the center of the galaxy. This behavior mimics that of a spinning disc with an even distribution of mass throughout. Despite the uneven distribution of stars in the galaxy, Rubin postulated this missing mass must be the same dark matter that Zwicky had mentioned some forty years earlier. After she published her results in 1980, other evidence soon followed that agreed with these observations, and it gradually became accepted that most observed galaxies consisted of a large amount of dark matter. </p>

<p>Galaxy cluster rotation and galaxy rotation are two similar ways of observing evidence for dark matter. A third method is via the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, whereby light is bent around a massive object on its way to an observer. Measurements using this method and an understanding of general relativity can predict the masses of the objects around which the light bends. These observations also lead astronomers to believe there is unaccounted-for mass in certain galaxies in a completely different fashion than the method of galaxy or cluster rotation. Dark matter proponents point to the fact that two separate phenomena producing a seemingly similar result is strong evidence of the existence of this dark matter. </p>

<p>Like most hypotheses, however, this one is not without inconsistent observations. Some collections of galaxies, known as globular clusters, show little or inconsistent evidence of dark matter. Other galaxies, known as dwarf galaxies for their small size, behave in a fashion consistent with how galaxies would behave in the complete absence of dark matter. While dark matter proponents have proposed potential resolutions to these issues, no evidence has come forth to support them and these remain anomalies. And all hypotheses that lack direct evidence must be subject to scrutiny from the discerning scientific eye. </p>

<p>Direct detection of dark matter in general has never been achieved. This is partly due to the fact that it is, in the first place, dark, and thus evades detection from telescopes and microwave detectors. Another issue is that the composition of dark matter is completely unknown, and a general consensus has not even been achieved on what it may be made of. Many physicists point to neutrinos, an extremely small, almost undetectable, electrically neutral elementary particle as the primary candidate for dark matter. Hypothetical particles have also been suggested as the primary constituents of dark matter. These range from WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) to MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects) to RAMBOs (Robust Associations of Massive Baryonic Objects) to form a colorful spectrum of imaginary names. </p>

<p>In 2006, a merging of two galaxies known as the Bullet Cluster gave proponents of dark matter serious hope, as subsequent observations of the cluster’s mass distribution was distinctly different than before the collision. After the collision of these clusters, the observable mass tended to congregate in the center of the pair, while most of the mass was determined to be on the outer region of the pair via gravitational lensing. This implies that the visible matter of one cluster was slowed down by the other via electromagnetic and gravitational forces, but the dark matter, not being subject to electromagnetic forces, passed through the collision and ended up on the outer edges of the pair. </p>

<p>An analysis of another cluster, however, seems to deal a blow to dark matter theory in the opposite way. The Train Wreck Cluster, observed in 2007, is the result of a merger between two clusters that ended up in exactly the opposite formation as the Bullet Cluster - that is, with a large “dark core” and visible matter on the outsides. Thus, either the logic that applied to the Bullet Cluster’s merging behavior is flawed, the logic applied to the Train Wreck Cluster’s merging is flawed, or there is some other explanatory framework that could play a part to save dark matter. Another option, of course, is that dark matter is not the phenomenon many astronomers have thought it was, and that an entirely new explanatory framework is required to account for all of the aforementioned phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="modified-gravity">Modified Gravity</h3>

<p>Much in the same way that Einstein had altered Newton’s views of gravity to make for a more comprehensive theory, Modified Gravity tries to alter both Newton’s and Einstein’s equations to fit cosmological data without positing the existence of dark matter. Modified gravity comes in many flavors that focus on different portions of Einstein’s field equations for general relativity or Newton’s original gravitation equation that still holds at relatively low speeds. Many of the theories build on the successes or failures of previous modified gravity theories and vary with respect to their ability to explain the different phenomena that lead to the postulation of dark matter. </p>

<p>In 1983 Mordehai Milgrom proposed Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in an attempt to explain the issue of galaxy rotation. He proposed that, at extremely low accelerations (like those found at the outer rim of a galaxy), Newton’s original equation of gravity does not hold, and the galaxy rotation curve flattens out at far enough distances. This correlates directly with observations of galaxy rotation that prompted Rubin to posit the existence of dark matter. The main issue with MOND is that it is non-relativistic - essentially allowing it to only be employed for phenomena occurring at low velocities, thus it cannot account for gravitational lensing effects. It did, however, serve as the fertile ground from which other modified gravity theories could spring.</p>

<p>Jacob Bekenstein provided in 2004 a relativistic version of MOND known as Tensor-Vector-Scalar Gravity, or TeVeS for short. TeVeS has enjoyed much success in describing both the galaxy rotation curve a la MOND as well as being able to explain gravitational lensing phenomena with accuracy. It also can be derived from more basic principles than MOND, and therefore respects conservation laws, which MOND under some circumstances does not. TeVeS has met criticism on a particularly interesting point - namely, the lifetime of a given star. Michael Seifert claims that a star in TeVeS would only have a lifetime of about two weeks, which is obviously an absurd conclusion to draw. Luckily for modified gravity proponents, TeVeS and MOND are two of a handful of theories attempting to explain away dark matter. 
Another non-intuitively-named theory emerged in 2006 through John Moffat known as Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG). It fundamentally states that at close enough distances mass is actually subjected to a repelling force and at large distances actually experiences a stronger force due to gravity than Newton had predicted. STVG has enjoyed huge successes in explaining problems of galaxy rotation, cluster mass, and gravitational lensing in the Bullet Cluster, as well as being completely in line with general relativity. The ideas of this theory are still awaiting further technological advances that would soon be able to verify or falsify further cosmological predictions. </p>

<p>A completely alternative theory of gravity, worth noting here due to its uniqueness, is the theory of entropic gravity, proposed by Erik Verlinde in 2009 and published in 2011. This theory essentially states that gravity is not a fundamental force of nature, but is rather the result of the Universe’s tendency towards increasing entropy, or disorder. The theory was greeted with much excitement and mixed reaction, and awaits further investigation to determine its effects on the debate over dark matter and modified gravity. </p>

<h3 id="philosophical-implications">Philosophical Implications</h3>

<p>The debate between whether dark matter or modified gravity is a more appropriate explanatory framework for the Universe not only relies on collection of data, but also on the philosophical implications of each. Both attempt, at least somewhat successfully, to rectify anomalies that arise when applying Newtonian gravity and general relativity to certain cosmological phenomena. The method by which each of these theoretical tools attempts to solve these issues has profound ontological implications and opens up fundamental questions about what science really is in the first place.</p>

<p>When faced with multiple competing explanations for the same phenomenon, a simple rule of thumb, named after the 14th century logician William of Ockham, can help narrow down the decision. Ockham’s Razor, also known as the law of parsimony, suggests that we “do not multiply entities beyond necessity”, or that we “choose the least complex explanation for a particular phenomenon.” Although this rule is not necessarily grounded in the mechanisms of logic like the principle of contradiction (a thing cannot be its opposite), it has been utilized by scientists throughout the years to construct a simple, harmonious picture of how the world works, and has had many successes. Sometimes these simpler explanations that arise from employing Ockham’s Razor end up being rejected later by experimental evidence and more complex mechanisms are determined to be the cause of a certain phenomenon. Either way, it is a most beneficial rule of thumb that can help “weed out” exceptionally extravagant propositions. </p>

<p>By positing dark matter’s existence in the cosmos, we are introducing another entity into our ontological understanding of the Universe. This is not like a mere addition of just another gadget, such as an iPhone, into our already populous realm of gadgets such as laptops, GPS devices, gameboys, and the like. Allowing dark matter into our Universal-physical ontology fundamentally alters the way in which matter is traditionally viewed - namely, its standing as the basic material constituent of Being. Outweighing ordinary visible matter by a factor of 5 to 1, dark matter thus constitutes the majority of reality as we know it - yet we cannot even point to what, exactly, it is.</p>

<p>The ungrounded nature of dark matter puts cosmology, astronomy, and physics in general on shaky footing, if on any footing at all. It has been noted that the term “dark matter” is more an expression of human ignorance, considering the composition, and thus the “thinghood”, of dark matter is unknown. For all we know, dark matter could be made up of fairies, angels, leprechauns, or any other agents that have been historically used to explain phenomena to children. It could also, of course, prove to be made up of neutrinos, WIMPs, RAMBOs, or MACHOs. Dark matter has been taken as an almost certainly existing entity, yet what is actually existing remains a mystery.</p>

<p>Modified gravity generally has the benefit of not multiplying entities beyond necessity. It takes Ockham’s Razor seriously and addresses this rule of thumb at its limits. A Newtonian view of gravity - that all gravitational phenomena behave according to a simple equation, was shown to be a shortsighted employment of this maxim. Much in the same vein, modified gravity attempts to show that Einstein’s general relativity is also an overly simple framework for the behavior of the cosmos. Instead of proposing a mysterious entity that behaves according to general relativity, modified gravity proposes that the mechanisms that govern the motion of matter are not quite fully understood, but can be. In this sense, modified gravity does not shake our Universal-physical ontology to its foundations, but seeks to better understand these foundations and explain the intricacies found within. </p>

<p>Both of these ideas generally fall within a scientific discussion in the field of physics. As a science, this discipline essentially deals with testable hypotheses and theories. Karl Popper sought to bring Science itself into relief by claiming that this activity necessarily deals with falsifiable claims, or ones that can be shown to be true or untrue. Claims that take themselves seriously and do not meet this requirement are essentially philosophical. Claims such as “god answers prayers” or “unicorns are real” tend towards theology or fiction, and aren’t relevant to the discussion at hand.</p>

<p>Solipsism, or the idea that all of reality is a mere hallucination or dream conjured up in one existing mind belonging to an observer, provides a fertile ground for a discussion on falsifiability. An individual can claim that there is no objective reality and that all he experiences is akin to a dream, but he has no way of actually determining whether or not this is true. Thus, solipsism has not found its way into the realm of science, and remains an interesting philosophical discussion point. </p>

<p>Much in the same way, dark matter must accept this same fate in the eyes of Popper. Since its composition, or essence, is fundamentally unknown, the claim, “dark matter exists” necessarily carries the same weight of the claim of solipsism. Yes, it is an interesting philosophical idea that allows physicists to stretch their minds, but does not necessarily prove to be falsifiable, and therefore cannot really be considered scientific. Modified gravity, on the other hand, is scientific for precisely this reason. Any equation conjured up by physicists researching the subject can, with the right equipment, be tested and subjected to Popper’s rigorous falsifiability test. If it fails, yet another hypothesis can be posed and tested, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the trusted scientific method that has built up the edifice of modern thought, and, as such, has a fine track record with regards to physical reality. This is not to mention the successes that modified gravity has had, particularly in the form of Moffat’s STVG, at explaining phenomena associated with dark matter. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Modified gravity has proven to be a formidable scientific pursuit, being able to describe phenomena usually explained through the existence of mysterious dark matter. Considering dark matter research is now underway and consists of spending millions of dollars to install detectors for only one of many potential candidates of its make-up, it seems that the priorities of the physics community are not in the right place. Providing funding for further research into modified gravity promises to lead to fruitful insights about the nature of the cosmos while staying true to science as a discipline. While the philosophical implications of dark matter no doubt have surfaced questions about the potential constitution of the Universe, there is not enough direct observational evidence to justify investing in further detectors designed to find neutrinos, WIMPs, leprechauns, or other potential constituents of this mysterious substance. In the spirit of Science, falsifiability, Ockham’s Razor, and pragmatism, it is hoped that funding which would otherwise go towards dark matter research may be redirected to the more ripe field of modified gravity in the belief that this will ultimately contribute to perhaps the most noble  and interesting of all human pursuits - the understanding of the Nature of the Universe. </p>
